###### Installation
```
npm i
npm run storybook
```

If you get errors after installing make sure to update you global packages

```
npm i -g name-of-package
```

Everything is developed in storybook.
Tests and documentation add-ons are added.
However it is also possible to run the application with webpack-dev-server

###### start webpack-dev-server
```
npm run start
```

It is also possible to run all tests from the command line

###### run tests
```
npm run mocha
```

I did not finish everything that was in the assignment.
However I do believe that this will give a good indication of my skills.

###### todo
- add more tests
- add more documentation
- add delete action to redux
- add delete button to shopping cart
- optimize build for production
- add footer
